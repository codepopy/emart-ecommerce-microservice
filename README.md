# Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot, Keycloak, and Kafka

This project demonstrates the development of a complete microservices architecture using Spring Boot, Kafka, Spring Cloud, and other technologies. It is built around Product, Order, and Inventory services, focusing on scalable and secure service interaction.

## Key Features

- **Microservices**: Product, Order, and Inventory services with independent databases.
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway for centralized routing.
- **Security**: Keycloak for authentication and authorization.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: REST and Kafka for synchronous and asynchronous communication.
- **API Documentation**: Generated and aggregated using Open API.
- **Resilience**: Circuit Breaker for fault tolerance.
- **Observability**: Grafana stack for monitoring and tracing.
- **Frontend**: Angular application for the user interface.
- **Deployment**: Containerized and deployed to Kubernetes for scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Kafka
- **Security**: Keycloak
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Observability**: Grafana, Prometheus
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
